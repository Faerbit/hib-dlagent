Description
===========

Primarily for use as a DLAGENT in makepkg.conf in Arch Linux, but generally
useful when needing to download a particular Humble Bundle file via a script.
The script does very little other than argument parsing; it effectively has only
two "real" lines of functionality.

It also manages a storage directory where already downloaded file can be found.

Installation and Usage
======================

Run the script directly or copy the script to a location like /usr/bin/ for all
users to use.

The tool uses curl to download the file, or can simply provide the URL needed to
download the file so a different HTTP downloader such a Wget can be used.

To use as a DLAGENT for the 'hib' scheme, you can modify makepkg.conf:
DLAGENTS=(...
    'hib::/usr/bin/hib-dlagent -k 1a2b3c -o %o %u'
    ...)

Run with the -h argument for more information.
